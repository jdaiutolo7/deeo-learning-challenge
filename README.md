# Deep Learning Challenge Report

## Overview
The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, youâ€™ll use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Results
* Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
    * How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why? I tried to use a smaller amount of neurons and layers at first, and then gradually increase the amount with each attempt to see how accuracy was effected
    * Were you able to achieve the target model performance? I was unable to get the model accuracy even over 73%
    * What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance? I added more neurons in the first attempt, more layers in the second, and more epochs in the third. I purposely didn't reset my changes in previous attempts because I wanted to see how accuracy would be impacted

## Summary
Despite changing a variety of variables and combining the attempts, accuracy was hardly effected. My guess is certain variables will need to be decreased when I increase others, rather than gradually increasing everything. However, perhaps the dataset itself needs to be larger for any significant strides in improving accuracy in the first place.
